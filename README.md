# SysReo Project

This repository presents the new modeling approach "SysReo" of an extract of the Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC) system case study.
SysReo relies on SysML, OCL, and Reo to capture the different aspects of CPS, including requirements, architecture, and interaction protocols.

The novelty of our approach relies in the combination of SysML and Reo to handle the complexity of CPS architecture and protocols, in the design step by proceeding incrementally. Furthermore, we define OCL constraints to specify rules to be respected to model consistently CPS.

The folder "CBTC Use Case Study" contains all the SysReo diagrams and the pdf file "CBTC_Use_Case_Study.pdf" details the whole case study.
